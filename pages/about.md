## ABOUT

GSA is the first federal agency to hire a Chief Customer Officer, with a mission to transform our organization into a customer-centric powerhouse of service and efficiency, and help program offices deliver an outstanding experience to our employees, partners, and customers.

The public expects the same level of service from government that they’d get from any private sector organization at scale. Recognizing this, GSA’s Office of Customer Experience is tasked to embed customer-centric thinking into our daily operations and ensure we deliver sound products, as well as great customer experiences. We aim to lead by example, and work with other federal agencies to instill a customer-first mindset across the entire federal government.

## MISSION

By putting customers at the core of our business, we will give customers a voice at the table, and motivate business lines to work together toward common, customer-centric outcomes.
